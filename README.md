# Supertrend-Trading-Bot
Python script for a trading bot based on the Suptertrend indicator, as demonstrated in this YouTube series: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvzuUVysUFOv5XEPHeqefgyHZcDfLxH-W

You can create a config file to store your private api keys and passphrases and import that into the main file for the bot.
I did not upload my config file so as to keep my api keys private.
Do not publicly display your private api keys that allow access to execute trades and transfer funds from exchanges.
